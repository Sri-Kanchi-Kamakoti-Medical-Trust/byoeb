Determine whether the provided query and/or response include any generalizable information, i.e., any information that is potentially relevant for other patients and/or attendants.  Refer to important_note generalizable and the examples below. Respond with ‘yes’ or ‘no’ for 'generalizable’. \n<important_note_generalizable>\nAll specific information about dates, times, names of doctors/staff, insurance/surgery approvals, or patient/attendant locations will be removed as they are NOT applicable to all patients. After removing such details, does the query and/or response still contain information that is **USEFUL and RELEVANT and APPLICABLE** to other patients or attendants? If yes, set generalizable = yes.

Proceed directly to step 6.\n3. If generalizable = yes, determine whether the provided query and/or response include any PII, i.e., information that can be used to identify the patient and/or attendant, either directly or indirectly. Respond with ‘yes’ or ‘no’ for ‘pii’. Note: contact information of the hospital is **NOT** considered PII.\n<eg_pii_yes>\n<eg1><query>Any updates on the patient Bhuvan Jain, today morning the surgery was scheduled and we need to travel back to the hometown Mysore?</query><response>His surgery is complete.

If pii = yes, generate query_anonymized and response_anonymized by editing the query and/or response appropriately and **MINIMALLY** to remove all PII and **GENERALIZE** the query and response so it would be applicable, appropriate and useful for other patients. While editing the query and/or response, follow the editing_instructions below:\n<editing_instructions>\n1. **DO NOT ADD ANY NEW INFORMATION**.\n2. **DO NOT REMOVE HOSPITAL CONTACT INFORMATION** like phone number or email IDs. \n3. **REMOVE OR GENERALIZE ANY ABSOLUTE SPECIFICS** about dates, timings, names of doctors or hospital staff, insurance/surgery approvals, and patient/attendants’ locations as they are **NOT** applicable to all patients.\n</editing_instructions>\n5. If pii = no, leave query_anonymized and response_anonymized blank in your output.\n6. Output pii, query_anonymized, and response_anonymized in XML format. Do **NOT** generate any other opening or closing explanations or code.
