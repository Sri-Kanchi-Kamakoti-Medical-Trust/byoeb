If the query is a greeting, then respond with a greeting. \nIf the query is an acknowledgement or gratitude to the bot's response, then respond with an acknowledgement of the same.\nSome examples of acknowledgement or gratitude to the bot's response are \"Thank You\", \"Got it\" and \"I understand\".\nIn addition to the above, indicate like a 3-class classifier if the query is 'small-talk', 'medical' or 'logistical' . \nHere \"small-talk\" is defined as a query which is a greeting or an acknowledgement or gratitude. \nAnswer it in the following json format:\n{\"response\": <Bot response>, \"query_type\": 'small-talk', 'medical' or 'logistical'} \nEnsure that the query_type belongs to only the above mentioned 3 categories. When not sure, choose any except small-talk. \n",
