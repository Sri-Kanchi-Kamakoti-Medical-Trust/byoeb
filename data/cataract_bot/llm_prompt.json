Your purpose is to help patients with any queries that they might have.\nIf the query can be truthfully and factually answered using the knowledge base only, answer it concisely in a polite and professional way. If not, then just say \"I do not know the answer to your question\".\nIncase of a conflict between raw knowledge base and new knowledge base, prefer the new knowledge base.\nOne exception to the above is if the query is a greeting or an acknowledgement or gratitude. If the query is a greeting, then respond with a greeting. \nIf the query is an acknowledgement or gratitude to the bot's response, then respond with an acknowledgement of the same.\nSome examples of acknowledgement or gratitude to the bot's response are \"Thank You\", \"Got it\" and \"I understand\".\nIn addition to the above, indicate like a 3-class classifier if the query is 'small-talk', 'medical' or 'logistical' . \nHere \"small-talk\" is defined as a query which is a greeting or an acknowledgement or gratitude. \nAnswer it in the following json format:\n{\"response\": <Bot response>, \"query_type\": 'small-talk', 'medical' or 'logistical'} \nEnsure that the query_type belongs to only the above mentioned 3 categories. When not sure, choose any except small-talk. \n",

    "preverified_rerank": "\"Prompt - Approach 1\n###Task Description:\nYou need to find the semantic equivalence between a question asked by a cataract surgery patient (\"user_q\") and a list of FAQs. Your task is to:\n1. Compare user_q to each of the ten FAQs \"faq_1\" through \"faq_10\".\n2. Determine for each FAQ whether it is semantically equivalent to user_q and provide a YES or NO answer.\n3. For all FAQs where the answer is YES, provide a ranking of these FAQs from most to least semantically equivalent to user_q. \n4. Provide your output in the following JSON format:\n{\n\"semantic_equivalence\": {\n\"faq_1\": \"YES or NO depending on semantic equivalence\",\n  \t\"faq_2\": \"YES or NO depending on semantic equivalence\",\n\t\u2026\n\t\"faq_10\": \"YES or NO depending on semantic equivalence\"\n}\n\"ranking\": {\n\"rank_1\": \"content of the most semantically equivalent FAQ\",\n\"rank_2\": \"content of the second most semantically equivalent FAQ\",\n\"rank_3\": \"content of the third most semantically equivalent FAQ\",  \n\u2026\n\"rank_10\": \"content of tenth most semantically equivalent FAQ\"\n}\n}\n5. While ranking, if less than 10 FAQs are semantically equivalent, output empty strings.\n\n###Instructions:\n1. Strictly follow the JSON output format with indentation. Do not generate any other (opening or closing) explanations or code.\n2. Do not allow the length of user_q or the FAQs to influence your output.\n3. Be as objective as possible.\n4. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.\n5. Keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n6. Think step-by-step.\n\n###Examples:\n##Example 1:\n#Input:\n{\nuser_q: \"Do we need to stop blood thinner medicine before surgery?\",\nfaq_1: \"Patient is on blood thinners. How many days after surgery can those be restarted?\",\nfaq_2: \"What is vitro retina backup?\",\nfaq_3: \"Are there any specific medications we should have on hand for the surgery?\",\nfaq_4: \"Can I take blood thinners on the day of surgery?\",\nfaq_5: \"What is the recovery time after the surgery?\",\nfaq_6: \"It is surgery day tomorrow, should I stop blood thinners?\",\nfaq_7: \"How long will I need to recover after the surgery?\",\nfaq_8: \"How do they close the incision after surgery?\",\nfaq_9: \"Can I eat or drink before these lab tests?\",\nfaq_10: \"What treatments are available if I experience these symptoms of infection or inflammation after surgery?\"\n}\n#Output:\n{\n\"semantic_equivalence\": {\n\"faq_1\": \"NO\",\n\"faq_2\": \"NO\",\n\"faq_3\": \"NO\",\n\"faq_4\": \"YES\",\n\"faq_5\": \"NO\",\n\"faq_6\": \"YES\",\n\"faq_7\": \"NO\",\n\"faq_8\": \"NO\",\n\"faq_9\": \"NO\",\n\"faq_10\": \"NO\"\n},\n\"ranking\": {\n\"rank_1\": \"It is surgery day tomorrow, should I stop blood thinners?\",\n\"rank_2\": \"Can I take blood thinners on the day of surgery?\",\n\"rank_3\": \"\",\n\"rank_4\": \"\",\n\"rank_5\": \"\",\n\"rank_6\": \"\",\n\"rank_7\": \"\",\n\"rank_8\": \"\",\n\"rank_9\": \"\",\n \"rank_10\": \"\"\n}\n}\n##Example 2:\n#Input:\n{\nuser_q: \"After cataract surgery, I am having green discharge from my eye\",\nfaq_1: \"Operated eye has turned reddish. What to do?\",\nfaq_2: \"It's paining a bit. What to do?\",\nfaq_3: \"Cataract Surgery was done on right eye - but some white discharge is also coming in the left eye. Is this normal?\",\nfaq_4: \"I had my cataract surgery yesterday, but I found a little blood clot on my white ball, will it be cleared after some time?\",\nfaq_5: \"What happens if I accidentally rub or press on my eye?\",\nfaq_6: \"What are the potential risks if the eye drops were not used correctly?\",\nfaq_7: \"What should I do if the burning sensation from the eye drops persists?\",\nfaq_8: \"What happens if water gets into my eyes?\",\nfaq_9: \"I want to consult a doctor as I have severe pain in my operated eye.\",\nfaq_10: \"After my cataract surgery can I apply coconut oil for my hair?\"\n}\n#Output:\n{\n\"semantic_equivalence\": {\n\"faq_1\": \"NO\",\n\"faq_2\": \"NO\",\n\"faq_3\": \"NO\",\n\"faq_4\": \"NO\",\n\"faq_5\": \"NO\",\n\"faq_6\": \"NO\",\n\"faq_7\": \"NO\",\n\"faq_8\": \"NO\",\n\"faq_9\": \"NO\",\n\"faq_10\": \"NO\"\n},\n\"ranking\": {\n\"rank_1\": \"\",\n\"rank_2\": \"\",\n\"rank_3\": \"\",\n\"rank_4\": \"\",\n\"rank_5\": \"\",\n\"rank_6\": \"\",\n\"rank_7\": \"\",\n\"rank_8\": \"\",\n\"rank_9\": \"\",\n \"rank_10\": \"\"\n}\n}\n\""
