Generate n appropriate questions that a cataract surgery patient or their attendant might ask CataractBot, and corresponding appropriate, complete, and detailed answers to those questions. **n should be between one and five inclusive**.

Each pair MUST include some information which is not present in the other pairs. Feel free to delete pairs if needed.\n4. Finally, each question's length MUST be **<character_limit>60</character_limit> CHARACTERS OR LESS**.  Note: **answers do not have a character_limit.**\n</rules>\n2. Output n and the question-answer pairs in XML format. Do **NOT** generate any other opening or closing explanations or code.

For each of the provided pairs (pair_1 through pair_n), determine ‘yes’ or ‘no’ whether it follow each of the below rules.\n<rules>\n1. is_grounded: i.e., each answer is **GROUNDED** within **ONLY the provided data_chunks**.\n2. is_selfcontained: each question includes all necessary context and details, so that it can be understood and answered somewhat **COMPLETELY** and **APPROPRIATELY** without referencing previous questions or answers. **There should not be any content specific to named individuals**.\n<eg_selfcontained_questions>\n<eg1>What can be eaten before surgery?</eg1>\n<eg2>When can I wash my hair after surgery?</eg2>\n</eg_selfcontained_questions>\n<eg_not_selfcontained_questions>\n<eg1>Tell me more about the side effects of surgery</eg1>\n<eg2>Ramachandra’s blood pressure is high, what to do?</eg2>\n</eg_not_selfcontained_questions>\n3. is_unique: Follow the is_unique_important_considerations below:\n<is_unique_important_considerations>\n1. **As long as no two pairs are completely identical, all pairs are unique.** A pair is unique even if it is a proper subset of another pair.A pair is unique even if it is thematically similar or overlapping with another pair.\n2. Do **NOT** consider data_chunk while determining uniqueness. **It is IRRELEVANT whether a pair replicates content from data_chunk.**\n3. If there is just one pair, it is automatically unique.\n</is_unique_important_considerations>\n</rules>\n2. For each pair, if any of is_grounded, is_selfcontained or is_unique is ‘no’, provide a specific explanation in 2-3 concise sentences. Else, leave the explanation blank.\n3. Output your validations and explanations in XML format. Do **NOT** generate any other opening or closing explanations or code.

You are provided n question-answer pairs (pair_1 through pair_n), some of which break one or more of the below rules. You are also provided an explanation whenever a pair breaks a rule. Carefully analyze each pair and explanation, and the below rules.\n<rules>\n1. is_grounded: each answer MUST be **COMPLETELY GROUNDED** within **ONLY the provided data_chunk**.\n2. is_selfcontained: each question **MUST** include all necessary context and details so that it can be understood and answered **COMPLETELY** and **APPROPRIATELY** without referencing previous questions or answers. **There should not be any content specific to named individuals.**\n<eg_selfcontained_questions>\n<eg1>What can be eaten before surgery?</eg1>\n<eg2>When can I wash my hair after surgery?</eg2>\n</eg_selfcontained_questions>\n<eg_not_selfcontained_questions>\n<eg1>Tell me more about the side effects of surgery</eg1>\n<eg2>Ramachandra’s blood pressure is high, what to do?</eg2>\n</eg_not_selfcontained_questions>\n3. is_unique: each question-answer pair MUST be **DISTINCT** from the other pairs. Each pair MUST include some information which is not present in the other pairs.\n4. Finally, each question's length MUST be **<character_limit>60</character_limit> CHARACTERS OR LESS**.  Note: **answers do not have a character_limit.**\n</rules>\n2. Ensure all pairs follow all the rules, by following the below instructions:\n<instructions>\n1. If a pair does not break any of the rules, i.e., if is_grounded AND is_selfcontained AND is_unique are ‘yes’ for that pair: **DO NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES TO IT.**\n2. If a pair breaks any of the rules, i.e, if is_grounded OR is_selfcontained OR is_unique is ‘no’ for that pair: use the explanation to make **APPROPRIATE and MINIMAL** edits to the question and/or answer, so that the pair follows all the rules. If you're still not completely confident the pair follows all the rules, you **MUST DELETE** the pair.\n3. **DO NOT CREATE ANY ADDITIONAL PAIRS.**\n</instructions>\n3. If you have deleted any pairs, update n so it is equal to the new total number of pairs.\n4. Output n and the edited question-answer pairs in XML format. There should be **between one and five inclusive** pairs in your output. Do **NOT** generate any other opening or closing explanations or code.  Sample output with five pairs:\n<output>\n<n>5</n>\n<pairs><pair_1><q>First question</q><a>First answer</a></pair_1><pair_2><q>Second question</q><a>Second answer</a></pair_2><pair_3><q>Third question</q><a>Third answer</a></pair_3><pair_4><q>Fourth question</q><a>Fourth answer</a></pair_4><pair_5><q>Fifth question</q><a>Fifth answer</a></pair_5></pairs>\n</output>\n</steps>"
