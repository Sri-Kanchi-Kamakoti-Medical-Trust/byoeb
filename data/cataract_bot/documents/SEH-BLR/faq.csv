;Question;Answer
0;How can cataract be treated?;Cataract is typically treated with a surgical procedure, to remove the lens of your eye and replace it with an artificial lens. The most common method is Phacoemulsification, which involves the use of a high-frequency ultrasound device. In some select centres, Femto LASER technology is used for a few steps of the cataract surgery. However, the availability of laser-assisted cataract surgery may vary across institutions. The surgery is generally safe and effective, restoring vision in the majority of cases, but it's not a cure in the sense of restoring the eye to its original condition before the cataract developed. It's best to consult your eye doctor to determine the most suitable treatment for your specific case and discuss your expectations.
1;How can I prepare myself for Cataract Surgery?;"Before the surgery, you should ensure the following:
1. Use eye drops as per instructions given by the Doctor.
2. On the day of surgery, take diabetes, blood pressure, heart, and seizure medications as prescribed by your concerned physician. Consult your doctor about blood thinners like Aspirin and Coumadin, and whether to continue other medications, herbal medicines, and supplements.
3. For local anesthesia, have a light meal before surgery, avoiding alcohol and tobacco 24 hours prior. For general anesthesia, refrain from eating for 8 hours and avoid liquids for some time before surgery. Discuss any dietary concerns with your healthcare team.
4. Plan to arrive at the hospital 3 hours before your scheduled surgery time.
5. Do not wear any ornaments. Be prepared to change into a hospital gown.
6. Please pay the amount for surgery/procedure at the cash counter ?? before you proceed to inpatient ward.
7. Be patient and cooperative with hospital personnel who may ask the same questions repeatedly for safety reasons.
8. Check if all investigations have been completed and inform the surgeon about any specific requests or clinical problems."
2;Why do I need to arrive at the hospital 3 hours before the surgery?;You are asked to arrive at the hospital 3 hours before your surgery to allow you to settle in and for some preoperative procedures and medications to be applied before you are wheeled into the surgical theatre.
3;Should I get operated at my native place, as there are also good hospitals there?;The decision on where to have your cataract surgery is a personal one and depends on various factors such as the quality of healthcare facilities available, the expertise of the doctors, your comfort level, and convenience. Doctors at ?? have experience of thousands of surgeries, but there may also be good hospitals elsewhere. It's important to consider post-operative care, including support for applying eye drops, and follow-up visits, which might be easier at a closer location. You should make this decision in consultation with your family and your doctor.
4;If a person gets operated here and then goes to his native place and if some problem occurs what should he do?;If a patient experiences any issues after cataract surgery, it's important to seek medical attention immediately. They can contact ?? at ?? or call ??. If they are unable to reach the hospital, they should visit a local eye doctor.
5;What documents should we bring with us to the hospital?;"You should bring the following items with you to the hospital: 
1. your medical insurance card and policy information, 
2. prior approval or preauthorization form from your insurance company where relevant, 
3. emergency contact information, 
4. a list of medications (how much and when taken) and the medicines you are using both for your eye and for other conditions (diabetes, hypertension etc), and
5. your primary care doctor / referring doctor's name and phone number if we need to reach out to them for any additional clarification or information."
6;Why is it important to bring my medications and their list to the surgery?;It's important to bring both your actual medications and their list to the surgery because it helps the medical team understand your current medication regimen. This information is crucial for them to manage your overall health and any other conditions you might have, and to avoid any potential drug interactions. It also ensures that you have your necessary medications with you during your hospital stay.
7;What are the different types of lenses?;"An IntraOcular lens (IOL) is a small artificial lens that replaces the eye's natural lens during cataract surgery, providing similar focusing power to the natural lens. The lenses typically used in cataract surgery are rigid lenses and foldable lenses. They determine the incision size. Most patients choose a foldable lens as the immediate recovery is faster. Among the foldable lenses, commonly used ones include monofocal lenses that correct for distance, EDOF or extended depth of focal lenses, and multifocal lenses. There are also other specific variations used for specific eye conditions. 

The most common lens used in cataract surgery is a monofocal IOL. This has one focusing distance. It is set to focus for close work, medium range or distance vision – chosen depending on your visual needs. Like most people you may wish to have it set for clear distance vision; this is best for driving, walking and seeing people at a distance. Generally eyeglasses are needed for reading or close work. 

A variant of the monofocal lens is the Aspheric IOLs that mimic the curvature of the eye’s natural lens and increase sharpness marginally especially in low light conditions. Toric IOLs can correct astigmatism (cyindrical power) because, like the astigmatic eye, they also have different powers in different directions that balances the eye’s astigmatism. A multifocal IOL is a premium IOL that provides both distance and near focus at the same time. The IOL has different zones set at different focusing powers. It may allow you to see clearly in the distance without glasses as well as read or use a computer, also without using glasses (although you still may need glasses for some circumstances, e.g., reading small newspaper print). EDOF or extended dept of vision IOLs enhance the depth-of-focus. 

There are also lenses that combine the attributes described. Lenses can come from various manufacturers, both Indian and imported. Based on your eye and lifestyle, recheck with your doctor if you want to understand your best option."
8;What are processes for insurance?;The claim process typically involves contacting your insurance company to know about your eligibility for cataract surgery. To get insurance pre-approval for your cataract surgery, you need to provide your insurance company with specific details such as the name of the hospital where the surgery will be performed, the name of the surgeon, and the specific procedure to be performed. It's recommended to start this process well in advance of your surgery date. However, the exact time frame can vary depending on your insurance company's policies. After the surgery, a set of documents need to be collected from the hospital for reimbursement. For more specific details, it's best to contact your insurance company or the ?? team at the hospital at ?? or call ??. They will guide you through the process and provide you with the necessary assistance.

After the surgery, a set of documents need to be collected from the hospital for reimbursement. Please contact your insurance company to know about your eligibility for cataract surgery and the ?? team at the hospital for the necessary documents.
12;Can you provide more information about pre-operative lab tests for cataract surgery?;Preoperative tests for cataract surgery typically include a complete eye exam, involving vision tests, intraocular pressure screening, detailed slit lamp examination, and retina evaluation. Once surgery is advised, additional investigations like Biometry, Keratometry, and Specular Microscopy help determine your IOL power and corneal shape. Additional tests may be recommended based on any other findings. A general health evaluation, including a blood pressure check, sugar, and recording any known drug allergies, is also crucial. Laboratory tests generally assess the overall health of the patient and identify any potential risks or complications for the surgery. Special tests like ECG, CXR, FBC, clotting studies, urea, and electrolytes are required only if indicated by the patient’s medical history or findings from the physical examination. Note that any specific instructions regarding these tests, such as whether you need to fast, will be provided by your eye doctor. It's important to follow your eye doctor's instructions and any specific directions regarding these tests for a smooth procedure.
13;For pre-operative lab tests do we need to come with an empty stomach?;There is no specific requirement about fasting for pre-operative lab tests for cataract surgery, or for routine checks like blood pressure and blood sugar. However, it's always best to follow the instructions given by your eye doctor or the lab performing the tests. If you have not received any specific instructions, it's a good idea to reach out to your eye doctor and confirm.
14;How much does the surgery cost?;The cost of cataract surgery can vary depending on several factors, including the type of procedure, the specific hospital or clinic, and the patient's insurance coverage. For insured patients, they may need to pay a co-payment or deductible, while non-insured patients may need to pay the entire surgery cost upfront. Please note that these are only estimations and the final amount payable would be explained after the surgery is completed.
15;What is the average duration of surgery procedures before patient can go back home?;It's not possible to provide an exact duration for your stay at the hospital on the day of your cataract surgery. The actual cataract surgery typically takes around 15 - 20 minutes. You will be asked to report in the morning, and the timing of your surgery will depend on the surgery list for the day. However, you would be wheeled into the preoperative area much earlier and also could be retained in the recovery area for some more time. If any combined procedure is needed or on the surgical table the eye doctor deems additional steps needed, the duration of the surgery would vary. After the surgery, the discharge process is typically completed in ?? hours time. So, you can expect to go back home a few hours after the surgery is completed. However, these times can vary based on individual circumstances, the type of anesthesia used, and hospital procedures. It's always best to follow the specific instructions given by your eye doctor.

17;The operation has been completed. What is the next procedure?;The next procedure after the operation is a ?? postoperative examination by your eye doctor, which usually takes place 3 to 4 hours after the surgery. During this examination, the eye doctor will look for any complications or early signs of inflammation or infection. After the examination, the eye doctor will provide you with postoperative instructions and prescribe medications, which may include eye drops. It's important to follow these instructions carefully to ensure a smooth recovery.
18;What should I do if the burning sensation from the eye drops persists?;If the burning sensation persists or is severe, stop the medicine and consult your eye doctor immediately.
