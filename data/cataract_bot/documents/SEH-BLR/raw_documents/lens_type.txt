Difference between Indian and Imported Lens 
Modern cataract surgery routinely is combined with the implantation of an IOL (Intraocular Lens). Indian and imported lenses are classified on where they are manufactured.â€¯ 
Today Indian lenses are among the maximum implanted across the world. There are a few studies that have compared outcomes, visual outcomes are comparable in both categories with comparable safety and efficacy. 
However there are subtle difference in the quality check and certifications of the Imported Implants. Most of them would be certified in other countries apart from India (FDA , CE etc). Indian IOLs need to be certified only by the Drug Controller General India (DCGI). Few that are being exported may have additional certifications. 
The base material used in acrylic IOLs in the imported category are mostly hydrophobic - this material is more inert than the hydrophilic IOLs (most Indian foldable IOLs) 
The costs of the imported IOLs would be many fold more than their Indian IOL, thereby affecting the overall cost of surgery to you as a patient.
